    {Dec 2024} {Research Assistant}{\link{https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/inet}{Max-Planck-Institut}}{Germany}
    {Now} {
        At Professor Anja Feldmann's Internet Architecture Research Group,
        I worked under the guidance of Florian Steurer (a PAM 2025 Best Long Paper Award winner)
        to develop a tool in Go to scan the enormous IPv6 reverse DNS tree and generate an IPv6 hitlist.
        To accomplish this, I extended an existing tool, YoDNS, which had previously been written
        by Florian Steurer to scan the forward DNS. During the experiment, we sent billions of queries
        to navigate the rDNS tree over the course of several days.
