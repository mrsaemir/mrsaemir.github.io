    {Oct 2024} {Internet Researcher}{\link{https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/inet}{Max-Planck-Institut}}{Germany}
    {Apr 2024} {
      During my time at MPI, I was tasked with analyzing a massive dataset of 3.5 billion DNS TXT records to identify insecure or malicious use cases. This project aimed to replicate the findings of the paper “TXTing 101: Finding Security Issues in the Long Tail of DNS TXT Records” by Van Der Toorn et al. (2020) and extend the analysis using a different dataset. There, my primary responsibilities included analyzing and categorizing unique DNS TXT records and investigating abnormal use cases.
